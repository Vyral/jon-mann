I’m asked regularly if we’re hiring, and if you’re wondering the same thing, you’re in luck: Yes, we currently are\! If you’re interested, I’d happily take your call to discuss this opportunity further.&nbsp;

Today I’ll take some time to discuss our company and some of the leading reasons why our team members have chosen to work with us. We’re no strangers to hiring clients either—I actually have two former clients who work for me. We’ve also added people to our team who come from out of state and are transferring their license over to Hawaii.&nbsp;

There are quite a few reasons you might enjoy working with us, and chief among them is our tiered commission split for experienced agents, which allows you to keep the bulk of what you earn without forfeiting any of it to pay franchise fees.&nbsp;

In addition, we don’t charge any monthly fees whatsoever, and we provide a host of services that assist you in writing and creating contracts as well as the sales training you may need.&nbsp;

Best of all, we believe in and promote agent engagement. My job is to engage with you and help you reach the heights of success. By working with us, you’ll have full autonomy to run your business within the larger business.&nbsp;

You’re at liberty to choose the clients, areas, and neighborhoods you’d like to work with. Rather than having you attend boilerplate office meetings, our virtual office approach will allow you to work out of your home office and engage with agents like yourself via email and phone.&nbsp;

This way, you can leverage your time serving your clients in the most effective, hands-on manner. As long as you have the passion to help your clients in achieving their real estate objectives, you’re bound for success with us.&nbsp;

If this opportunity captures your attention, feel free to give me a call. We’re actively looking to add new team members, and we’d be delighted to have a conversation with you\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
