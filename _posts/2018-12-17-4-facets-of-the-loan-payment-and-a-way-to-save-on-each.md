Today I’ll discuss four facets of loan payments and how to keep costs down for each:&nbsp;

**1. Down payment.** While the down payment on a conventional loan requires 20% down, which can be steep for properties with a median price of $400,000 for condominiums and $700,000 to $800,000 for a single-family, there are other loan options out there—portfolio loans traditionally require 10% down, or even sometimes as little as 5% down, provided you meet some conditions. Government-backed FHA loans can be a sound choice as they only require 3% down, though, again, these loans are more restrictive. The best choice for veterans is the VA loan, which requires no down payment.&nbsp;

**2. Monthly payments.** If you’re someone that has $100,000 or $200,000 in the bank, try directing that money toward your down payment early on, rather than having to finance more later. If your loan has a 20% down payment requirement, put 25% down. That extra 5% can make all the difference if you want to manage your month-to-month cash flow and stay on top of those monthly payments.&nbsp;

**3. Closing costs.** The best method to minimize closing costs is to ask the seller for a credit at closing. With the exception of fiercely competitive bidding war situations, I’ve found that sellers will accept an offer and give the buyer a $2,000, $5,000, or even $10,000 of credit toward the cost. This is a great way to cut down on the out-of-pocket expenditure that comes with purchasing a home.&nbsp;

**4. Carrying (or holding) costs.** The interest payments you’re making throughout the life of your mortgage are tax deductible, and applying appropriate tax strategies will ensure that your tax obligations are kept lower.&nbsp;
