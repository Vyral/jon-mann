I’m often asked whether people should rent a home or buy a home here on Oahu, but there’s no real one-size-fits-all answer: it depends on your specific situation. Generally speaking, it’s usually in your best interest to buy a home instead of rent one, but today we’ll be looking at the benefits of each.

**How to find out if you should rent or buy:**

**1. How long do you plan to live in Hawaii?** If you’re only going to be here for six months or a year or two, it may be better to rent. There are a lot of up-front costs for buying a home, and you likely won’t be able to recoup them if you leave after a short time.

<br>**2. Do you have a stable source of income?** If your job situation or income is uncertain, it may be better to rent. It’s much easier to get out of a rental situation than a mortgage.

<br>**3. Do you have enough for a down payment?** If you don’t have the money saved up, it may be best to rent for a year or two in order to save.

**Why you should buy:**

**1. You have the opportunity for appreciation.** Over the last 40 years here, appreciation has been around 4% a year. If you own a property for at least three years, it’ll appreciate by about 12%. Closing costs are about 8%, so you’d come out with a 4% profit if you sold after three years. At two years you’d be breaking even, and one year would mean a loss.

<br>**2. You’ll save on taxes.** Price points for single-family homes are around $800,000 and condos are about $300,000. Buying a home usually means taking out a mortgage, and the higher the price point, the more interest you’ll pay. Fortunately, the government allows tax savings through mortgage interest deductions. You won’t get this by renting.

<br>**3. You can modify your home however you like**. Landlords control rented property and decide what can and can’t be changed. If you own your own home, you can do with it as you please.&nbsp;
