The spring selling season is just around the corner, so it’s the perfect time to get your home ready to list. Here are six ways to prepare your home for the spring market:

**1. Let in more light.** Let in natural light by opening shades, windows, and curtains, and make sure light bulbs are working throughout the home. This allows buyers to see all the areas of your property; if it’s dark, they’ll have a hard time envisioning themselves living in your home.

<br>**2. Consider minor renovations.** &nbsp;If you’ve lived in your home for a long time, some things are likely out of date. Old faucets, door handles, and cabinetry handles can be easily replaced without spending a fortune. It helps your home look less dated and gives a good first impression. If you want to change out kitchen cabinets, why not simply paint them instead? A fresh coat can make just as big of a difference.

<br>**3. Improve curb appeal.** Instead of spending your money on pricey renovations and upgrades, focus on making your home stand out. Many buyers judge your home based on what it looks like from the outside. If you have great curb appeal, buyers will be more willing to overlook small issues inside the home.

<br>**4. Paint your walls.** Painting walls and replacing carpeting are two of the most cost-effective ways to spruce up your home. I suggest white or neutral colors—don’t overdo it with bold choices and accent walls. Keep it looking bright, simple, and clean.

<br>**5. Fix minor repairs.** When buyers see something that’s broken, they get a negative impression. It also makes them think, “What else could be wrong?” Fix broken door handles, leaking faucets, and other minor repairs so buyers don’t see your home as poorly maintained.

<br>**6. Pay attention to odors.** There’s a saying in real estate: If I can smell it, I can’t sell it. If there are heavy odors from smoke, pets, or smelly food, buyers will most likely be turned off. Try to mitigate these aromas as much as you can.
