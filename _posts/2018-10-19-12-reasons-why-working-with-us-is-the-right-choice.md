Each week, I’m asked why a person should choose to work with Jon S. Mann Real Estate to help them buy a home in Hawaii. Well, today I want to give you 12 reasons why working with us is the right way to go:

1. We listen to your needs and wants. On top of that, we also take time to understand the ‘why’ behind your needs and wants so that we can help you select the right home.&nbsp;
2. We’ll educate you about current market conditions. Real estate is locally specific, and there are different conditions in each of the 200+ neighborhoods we have here on the island. We can inform you about what’s going on in any of them.
3. We can connect you with lenders who have proven track records of success. They can help you get a great interest rate and also help you close your home in a timely manner.
4. We’ll provide you with a copy of my e-book, “How To Buy A Home In Hawaii.”
5. We have a custom-branded mobile app that allows people to search for properties available across the island.
6. We’ll help you preselect properties that are in your price range and that meet your needs and wants.
7. We will tour those properties with you and tell you about the pros and cons that each has.
8. We will help you create a winning strategy to help you buy a home you’re interested in for a great price. In this competitive market, it’s very important that you have a good strategy.
9. We will handle all negotiations and communications with the seller. This is our company’s strong suit; we’re excellent at negotiating a great deal for you.
10. We will help arrange all the inspections and be there to ensure your home is safe and sound.
11. We’ll be sure that you get a complete and timely estimate of your closing costs so there are no surprises.
12. We will be at closing when you sign the documents.
