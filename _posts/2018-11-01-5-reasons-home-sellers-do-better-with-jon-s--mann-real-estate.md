Each week, I’m asked why a person should choose to work with Jon S. Mann Real Estate to help them buy a home in Hawaii. Well, today I want to give you five reasons why working with us is the right way to go:

1. **We have a risk-free performance guarantee.** We guarantee that we’ll sell your home in 180 days or fewer, or else we’ll pay you $1,000 at closing. I’ve been in the real estate business for 15 years, and I’ve never failed to sell a home. Even though we’ve never had to pay up, we still offer this as a guarantee, just in case.
2. **We have an easy-exit listing agreement.** With just a day’s notice, you can walk away from a contract with us. Some bigger firms require you to stay under contract for an entire year without any way for you to exit if you’re unhappy with their service, but not us. Again, in my 15 years, I’ve never had this happen.
3. **Our communication guarantee.** You’ll never wonder what’s going on with your home because we’ll call or meet with you in person at least every other week to discuss your listing’s progress and the marketing strategy we use to get it sold.
4. **Our 77-step selling system.** Our selling system is very detailed, and I couldn’t possibly relay all the steps here, but I’d be happy to do so during the listing presentation. We have a comprehensive marketing and advertising plan, using everything from open houses, social media, 3D scans, to whatever else it takes to sell your home.
5. **We put more money in your pocket.** Over the last 15 years, if you’re looking at list-to-sales price ratios, our clients earn 2% more than they would have with the average MLS agent. On a $500,000 home, that’s $10,000 more in your pocket.
