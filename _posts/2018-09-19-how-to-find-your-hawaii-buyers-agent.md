On the island of Oahu right now there are about 8,000 real estate agents available and only about 4,000 properties for sale. So if you’re looking to buy, how do you choose who to work with?

The two best ways to find an agent are to have a friend or family member refer them to you or to interview a few local professionals. If you choose to go through the interview process, there are a couple of things that you need to keep in mind.

The first thing you need to keep in mind is that the agent you choose should be experienced. You want someone who has lived in Hawaii for a while.

**You also will want to know how long they’ve been an agent.** Buying a home is one of the most expensive purchases you’ll ever make, so you need to make sure that you’re doing it with the help of someone who knows what they’re doing.

It is also very important that your agent knows your circumstances and what you’re comfortable paying. If they specialize in selling multi-million dollar homes but you’re interested in a $500,000 condo, they may not be the best fit for you.

**When considering an agent, make sure that they have the time to work with you.** I assure you this won’t be the issue if you choose to work with me or a member of my team. We will find the time to help you achieve success in your real estate goals.

Your buyer’s agent should listen to your needs and wants, and then help educate you on the market conditions. This way, you’ll understand the current inventory levels, interest rates, and more. The right agent should also be able to introduce you to service providers who can assist you throughout the transaction, like home and termite inspectors. Finally, the right agent should be able to guide you through the process from contract to close.

If you have any questions about this, or if you’re interested in speaking with me or a member of my team about buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
