<br>I’ve been in the real estate business for about 15 years now, and I can assure you that **almost every home seller in the market has three particular fears:**

**1\. That their home won’t sell.** I can assure you that, if you work with Jon S. Mann Real Estate, we will sell your home for you. In my career, we’ve sold every single home that we’ve had except for one—in that case, the seller declined to accept the offer that was given. In fact, we guarantee that we’ll sell your home in six months; if we don’t, we’ll pay you $1,000.

**2\. That it will take too long to sell.** We perform about 185 different tasks in order to sell a client’s home, and on that list is to work within your specific timeframe, whether that be to sell in 30 days, 60 days, or even 90 days. I even once had a client who asked me to help him sell his home in just seven days. Not only did we succeed, but we also had multiple offers and ended up getting a very good price for it.

**3\. That their home will sell for too little.** We pride ourselves on educating clients about market conditions, including about what kind of market we’re in and what the price points are in your neighborhood. This will allow us to position your home to sell for the most money possible.

Even though these three fears are common amongst all sellers, we want to emphasize that Jon S. Mann Real Estate can handle anything that comes our way. Here on the team, we like to say that “fear” stands for “**f**alse **e**vents **a**ppearing **r**eal.” **Failing to sell, taking too long to sell, and selling for too little a price are, indeed, false events when you work with us.**

If you have any questions about these fears or selling your home in general, don’t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>&nbsp;
