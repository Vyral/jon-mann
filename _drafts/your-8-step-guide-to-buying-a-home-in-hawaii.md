Here in Hawaii, there are eight specific steps to buying a home:

**1. Find a good local agent.** I’d certainly be happy to help you in this regard, but if not, remember that there are certain questions you need to ask an agent to find whether they’re really qualified to assist you.

**2. Find a good local lender.** Some of the home buying rules are different here than they are on the mainland, so it’s important that you find a local lender.

**3. Understand the Hawaii home buying process.** Like I touched on in the previous step, parts of the home buying process are different here than in other places. I’ve lived here for 15 years and I’ve had an opportunity to learn what these differences are, but for now just know that there are about 25 activities in total that you go through from start to finish.

**4. Find the right neighborhood.** This is the step people usually take first. As the saying goes, the most important things in real estate are location, location, location, so the neighborhood you choose to live in is very important.

**5. Find the right house (or condominium or townhouse).** There are a lot of considerations to make as far as this step goes. For example, here on Oahu, we have a lot of condominiums for sale.

**6. Understand the Hawaii home inspection process.** This step is key to ensuring that you’re buying a home that’s in good condition and is safe and sound.

**7. Understand the costs of homeownership in Hawaii.** You need to know all the different costs of maintaining your home over time, because they can be rather substantial.

**8. Understand Hawaii standard real estate contracts.** We have very unique contracts here in Hawaii, and I’d be happy to help you understand how they work.

In future videos, I’ll discuss how to go through each of these steps, but in the meantime, if you have any other real estate questions or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, feel free to call or email me anytime. I’d be happy to help you.
