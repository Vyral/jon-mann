Today’s common question we're answering is: **“What projects can I do around the house that might add value to it?”**

There are a lot of things that you could do to your home that are inexpensive, pretty simple, and able to add value. **Here are five of them:**

**1. Modernizing your fixtures.** From the electrical outlets to the doorknobs, fixtures can be replaced pretty cheaply and give a modern touch and a good first impression to buyers if you plan on selling.

**2. Lightening up the place.** Take a look at your light fixtures. If they’re old or dated, replacing them might be a good idea; they can also improve your energy efficiency.

**3. Small bathroom makeover.** Expensive renovations in the bathroom can bring a lot of value, but it can also get pricey. A few minor touches such as replacing the mirror, the vanity, or the faucet in the shower can make the room look newer and nicer without a lot of investment.

**4. Small kitchen makeover.** Instead of new appliances and cabinetry, you can repaint the kitchen and cabinets and replace the knobs on the cabinet doors.

**5. Address any maintenance issues.** Whether it’s a leak, a glitchy light, or a wobbly ceiling fan, you can replace all of these things inexpensively. I’d be happy to give you the name of a good handyman who can take care of stuff like this for you.
